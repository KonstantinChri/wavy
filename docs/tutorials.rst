The following tutorials describe how to setup the wavy config files, to perform collocation and validation tasks. **wavy** is intended to be fleksibel such that customization can be achieved with minimal changes in the code. The *wavy* config files build the fundament for this approach and can be compared to namelist files often used for runtime changes in numerical modelling.

1. The *wavy* config files, a brief overview.

1. downloading satellite observations, downloading model data, collocating model and observations, dump collocation to netcdf file, validate the collocated time series and
